# Controllable Window Lock
Locks your device screen into any program(s) of your choice, for a set timer.

## Usage
Select a window with the ComboBox shown at the top of the program. If your desired window isn't present, click File -> Refresh to refresh the list of active windows.
Set the window you have selected as the target for the force function using the button.
You can also add windows to the whitelist. Focusing on whitelisted windows will not set your focus back to the target program.
Set a timer (seconds, minutes, hours) at the bottom of the program, and press force, the program will then start.

If you wish to pause the program or to stop it, you can use a hotkey.
Pausing is bound to F5 by default, while Aborting is bound to F6 by default.
See [Hotkeys](#hotkeys) for more information.

## Quality of Life
### Presets
Under File, you will see a "Save" and a "Load" function.
Save will save your current target, whitelist, and timer into a file.
This file can then be loaded with Load, which will update all of your configurations.

### Settings
Under File, you will also see a "Settings" option.
This option will open a new window, and you can adjust your settings there.
Make sure to press "Apply" to save these settings.
These settings save between usages of this program.

### Hotkeys
In the settings GUI, you will also see a list of hotkeys.
Press the buttons assigned to the hotkeys to assign them to another button of your choice.
